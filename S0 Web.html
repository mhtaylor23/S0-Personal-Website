			<h1>I'm Morgan Taylor and I'm a Junior BDes Major. </h1>
		
			<p>It's been about a year since I've done anything with Web Design, so I have to use W3Schools for help to remember some things. <br>
			I just switched into this class because I've noticed that a lot of jobs want people who have Web Design experience. I was in Motion Design, but I don't think the animation route  <br>is for me anymore.
			I'm excited to get back into Web Design and hopefully don't humiliate myself like I did a year ago. My website I made looked great and then it transferred over to the computers in the lab	and all the dimensions were screwed up and it looked terrible. That's the main reason I took a break from Web Design. 
			<br>
			<br>
			My problem now is that I'm rusty with this stuff since I took a year off and I just trashed my room looking for my notes I took in Intro to Web and I can't find them anywhere!
			<br> I hope I can rebound fast!
